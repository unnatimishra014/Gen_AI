1,"Basics of Cloud Computing 
Cloud Computing is a technology that allows you to store and access data and applications over the 
internet instead of using your computer’s hard drive or a local server. 
In cloud computing, you can store different types of data such as files, images, videos, and 
documents on remote servers, and access them anytime from any device connected to the internet. 
• Infrastructure: Cloud computing depends on remote network servers hosted on the Internet 
to store, manage, and process data. 
• On-Demand Access: Users can access cloud services and resources on demand, scaling up or 
down without having to invest in physical hardware. 
• Types of Services: Cloud computing offers various benefits such as cost saving, scalability, 
reliability, and accessibility. It reduces capital expenditures, and improves efficiency.

complexity, speeding up the Execution time and bringing the updates quickly to market by 
streamlining the development process. 
• Automation of Scaling: Management of resource scaling, guaranteeing the program's 
workload efficiency is ensured by PaaS. 
3. Software as a Service (SaaS) 
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a way of using software over the internet instead of installing it on 
your computer. The software is hosted by a company, and you can use it just by logging in through a 
web browser. You don’t need to worry about updates, maintenance, or storage the provider takes 
care of all that. 
A common example is Google Docs. You can write and share documents online without downloading 
any software.

What is an Amazon S3 bucket? 
Amazon S3 bucket is a fundamental Storage Container feature in AWS S3 Service. It provides a secure 
and scalable repository for storing of Objects such as Text data, Images, Audio and Video files over 
AWS Cloud. Each S3 bucket name should be named globally unique and should be configured with 
ACL (Access Control List). 
How Does Amazon S3 works? 
Amazon S3 works on organizing the data into unique S3 Buckets, customizing the buckets with 
Acccess controls. It allows the users to store objects inside the S3 buckets with facilitating features 
like versioning and lifecycle management of data storage with scaling. The following are a few main 
features of Amazon s3:

22,"features of Amazon s3: 
1. Amazon S3 Buckets and Objects 
Amazon S3 Bucket: Data, in S3, is stored in containers called buckets. Each bucket will have its own 
set of policies and configurations. This enables users to have more control over their data. Bucket 
Names must be unique. Can be thought of as a parent folder of data. There is a limit of 100 buckets 
per AWS account. But it can be increased if requested by AWS support. 
Amazon S3 Objects: Fundamental entity type stored in AWS S3.You can store as many objects as you 
want to store. The maximum size of an AWS S3 bucket is 5TB. It consists of the following: 
• Key 
• Version ID 
• Value 
• Metadata 
• Subresources 
• Access control information 
• Tags 
2. Amazon S3 Versioning and Access Control"
23,"S3 Versioning: Versioning means always keeping a record of previously uploaded files in S3. Points to 
Versioning are not enabled by default. Once enabled, it is enabled for all objects in a bucket. 
Versioning keeps all the copies of your file, so, it adds cost for storing multiple copies of your data. 
For example, 10 copies of a file of size 1GB will have you charged for using 10GBs for S3 space. 
Versioning is helpful to prevent unintended overwrites and deletions. Objects with the same key can 
be stored in a bucket if versioning is enabled (since they have a unique version ID). To know more 
about versioning refer this article - Amazon S3 Versioning 
Access control lists (ACLs): A document for verifying access to S3 buckets from outside your AWS 
account. An ACL is specific to each bucket. You can utilize S3 Object Ownership, an Amazon S3 
bucket-level feature, to manage who owns the objects you upload to your bucket and to enable or 
disable ACLs."
24,"bucket-level feature, to manage who owns the objects you upload to your bucket and to enable or 
disable ACLs. 
3. Bucket policies and Life Cycles 
Bucket Policies: A document for verifying the access to S3 buckets from within your AWS account, 
controls which services and users have what kind of access to your S3 bucket. Each bucket has its 
own Bucket Policies. 
Lifecycle Rules: This is a cost-saving practice that can move your files to AWS Glacier (The AWS Data 
Archive Service) or to some other S3 storage class for cheaper storage of old data or completely 
delete the data after the specified time. To know more about refer this article - Amazon S3 Life Cycle

also who can access the bucket. You can make the bucket public or private by default the S3 buckets 
will be in private mode."
27,"Step 4: You can manage the S3 bucket lifecycle management by transitioning. Based upon the rules 
that you defined S3 bucket will be transitioning into different storage classes based on the age of the 
object which is uploaded into the S3 bucket. 
Step 5: You need to turn to enable the services to monitor and analyze S3. You need to enable the S3 
access logging to record who was requesting the objects which are in the S3 buckets. 
What are the types of S3 Storage Classes? 
AWS S3 provides multiple storage types that offer different performance and features and different 
cost structures.  
• Standard: Suitable for frequently accessed data, that needs to be highly available and 
durable. 
• Standard Infrequent Access (Standard IA): This is a cheaper data-storage class and as the 
name suggests, this class is best suited for storing infrequently accessed data like log files or 
data archives. Note that there may be a per GB data retrieval fee associated with the 
Standard IA class."
28,"data archives. Note that there may be a per GB data retrieval fee associated with the 
Standard IA class. 
• Intelligent Tiering: This service class classifies your files automatically into frequently 
accessed and infrequently accessed and stores the infrequently accessed data in infrequent 
access storage to save costs. This is useful for unpredictable data access to an S3 bucket. 
• One Zone Infrequent Access (One Zone IA): All the files on your S3 have their copies stored 
in a minimum of 3 Availability Zones. One Zone IA stores this data in a single availability zone. 
It is only recommended to use this storage class for infrequently accessed, non-essential 
data. There may be a per GB cost for data retrieval. 
• Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS): All the other S3 classes ensure the durability of 
99.999999999%. RRS only ensures 99.99% durability. AWS no longer recommends RRS due to 
its less durability. However, it can be used to store non-essential data."
