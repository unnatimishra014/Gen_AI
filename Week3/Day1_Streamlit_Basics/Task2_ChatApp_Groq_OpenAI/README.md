# 🚀 Groq Streamlit Chat (Open Source)

💬 Minimal Streamlit chat application using the Groq Python SDK with streaming responses.

## 📦 What you get
- 📝 Streamlit app (`app.py`) that connects to Groq's Chat Completions API and streams responses.
- 🔄 Uses Streamlit `session_state` to maintain conversation history.
- 📂 Example `requirements.txt` and deployment instructions.

## 🖥️ How to run locally
1. Create a Python 3.10+ virtualenv and activate it.
2. 📦 Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. 🔑 Set your Groq API key in the environment:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```
   Or create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```
4. ▶️ Run:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## ☁️ Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud (Streamlit Cloud)
1. 📤 Create a public GitHub repository and push these project files.
2. 🔗 Login at https://share.streamlit.io with your GitHub account.
3. ⚡ Click **Create app**, pick the repository, branch, and `app.py` file, then **Deploy**.
4. 🔐 Add the `GROQ_API_KEY` to your app's Secrets (Settings → Secrets) on Streamlit Cloud. Do **not** hardcode the key.

## ⚠️ Notes & Caveats
- 🌊 This example uses Groq's streaming API. Streaming yields partial deltas; the code attempts to handle a few delta shapes but may need slight adjustment if Groq changes the payload format.
- 🛠️ The app is intentionally minimal for quick deployment. You can extend it with message roles, RAG, or file upload.
